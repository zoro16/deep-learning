    box_confidence -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 1)
    boxes -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 4)
    box_class_probs -- tensor of shape (19, 19, 5, 80)
    threshold -- real value, if [ highest class probability score < threshold], then get 
    rid of the corresponding box
    
    Returns:
    scores -- tensor of shape (None,), containing the class probability score for 
    selected boxes
    boxes -- tensor of shape (None, 4), containing (b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w) coordinates of 
    selected boxes
    classes -- tensor of shape (None,), containing the index of the class detected by the
    selected boxes
    
    Note: "None" is here because you don't know the exact number of selected boxes, as 
    idepends on the threshold. 
    For example, the actual output size of scores would be (10,) if there are 10 boxes.
